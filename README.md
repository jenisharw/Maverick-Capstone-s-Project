# Maverick-Capstone-s-Project
## Problem Statement 
Maverik, a subsidiary of FJ Management specializing in gas stations and convenience stores, aims to open 30 new stores annually. Accurate performance projections for these new stores are crucial for their successful establishment and continual operations. Our team, known as "Top Gun: Maverik," has been entrusted with developing a forecasting model that surpasses the current simplistic model in use. This new model will leverage available data to project daily revenue at the store level for the upcoming year. It will also forecast the daily sales of specific items such as gasoline, diesel, in-store merchandise, in-store food, and other products.

By delivering precise predictions, our model will enable Maverik to construct more precise financial plans and offer more valuable initial estimations of Return on Investment (ROI). The objective of our Modeling notebook is to address Maverik's revenue forecasting challenge by predicting store sales across various item categories—such as gas and food—on a day-to-day basis for a full year. Additionally, the model will continuously update the annual day-over-day forecast as actual revenue data becomes available. The notebook's purpose is to explore and compare different models to solve this problem, ultimately selecting the best-performing one based on crucial performance metrics, especially focusing on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

## Our team's responsibility is to develop a forecasting model using the data at hand.
#This model aims to deliver:
- Predictions of daily revenue at the individual store level for the upcoming year.
- Anticipated sales figures for distinct items like gasoline, diesel, in-store merchandise, and in-store food on a daily basis.
- A comparison between the actual sales recorded at each store on a particular day and the predictions made by our model.

## Group's solution to the business problem.

Maverik wants our model to be really good. We use numbers to check how good it is.
One number, RMSE, tells us if the model is close to reality. The best model we made is called XGB.
Another number, "Days to 5%," shows how quickly our model gets predictions right. Maverik wants quick and accurate predictions. We're still figuring out how fast our model can do this.
We found out that the most important things for our model are recent sales and sales during certain times of the year. These things help our XGB model predict sales better.
Our model is good, but it could be better if we had more data, like location info. With more time and data, we can make it even better for Maverik to use in their stores.
