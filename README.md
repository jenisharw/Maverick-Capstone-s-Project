# Maverick-Capstone-s-Project
## Problem Statement 
Maverik, a subsidiary of FJ Management specializing in gas stations and convenience stores, aims to open 30 new stores annually. Accurate performance projections for these new stores are crucial for their successful establishment and continual operations. Our team, known as "Top Gun: Maverik," has been entrusted with developing a forecasting model that surpasses the current simplistic model in use. This new model will leverage available data to project daily revenue at the store level for the upcoming year. It will also forecast the daily sales of specific items such as gasoline, diesel, in-store merchandise, in-store food, and other products.

By delivering precise predictions, our model will enable Maverik to construct more precise financial plans and offer more valuable initial estimations of Return on Investment (ROI). The objective of our Modeling notebook is to address Maverik's revenue forecasting challenge by predicting store sales across various item categories—such as gas and food—on a day-to-day basis for a full year. Additionally, the model will continuously update the annual day-over-day forecast as actual revenue data becomes available. The notebook's purpose is to explore and compare different models to solve this problem, ultimately selecting the best-performing one based on crucial performance metrics, especially focusing on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

## Our team's responsibility is to develop a forecasting model using the data at hand.
#This model aims to deliver:
- Predictions of daily revenue at the individual store level for the upcoming year.
- Anticipated sales figures for distinct items like gasoline, diesel, in-store merchandise, and in-store food on a daily basis.
- A comparison between the actual sales recorded at each store on a particular day and the predictions made by our model.

## Group's solution to the business problem.

Maverik wants our model to be really good. We use numbers to check how good it is.
One number, RMSE, tells us if the model is close to reality. The best model we made is called XGB.
Another number, "Days to 5%," shows how quickly our model gets predictions right. Maverik wants quick and accurate predictions. We're still figuring out how fast our model can do this.
We found out that the most important things for our model are recent sales and sales during certain times of the year. These things help our XGB model predict sales better.
Our model is good, but it could be better if we had more data, like location info. With more time and data, we can make it even better for Maverik to use in their stores.

## Contribution
In EDA I Have done all the interpretations part and writing with the results.And See all the necessary visulaization of the project. Along with that I have tried to so all the comparison the the performance metrics of the naive model with our XGBoost model , visualization between actual and predicted values. Along with that done the Weekly Sales Trends:
and figure it All items struggle on weekends after a strong Friday, diesel worst of all with the visualization . And also done the visualization in seasonal trend with the product.
And created the some suggestion to the maverick to uplift their business.such 
As Stock Up -- Prepare more inventory for the summer, especially in June and July.
Staff Accordingly -- Schedule extra staff during these peak months
Promotion -- Consider special offers in April to capitalize on increased gas sales.
Plan Ahead  -- Use these patterns to plan for the busy season in advance

## The business value of the solution.
Given the importance of launching new stores successfully and maintaining growth in existing locations, our team has a key role. This model needs to be better than the simple one that's been in use for a few weeks. Its success will impact how well we choose new locations, open them, and keep them running smoothly, while also ensuring existing stores continue to grow.  We find out that Maverik sells the most during the summer, with a big jump in snacks and fuel sales in June and July. People also buy a lot of gas in April, maybe for spring road trips. This helps Maverik know when to have more items in stock and when to have more workers on hand.
Suggestion
# With those respective trends we can make planning stock levels and promotions to match customer buying patterns.
Stock Up -- Prepare more inventory for the summer, especially in June and July.
Staff Accordingly -- Schedule extra staff during these peak months
Promotion -- Consider special offers in April to capitalize on increased gas sales.
Plan Ahead  -- Use these patterns to plan for the busy season in advance.

## Difficulties that your group encountered along the way.

Model Complexity: Developing a forecasting model that accurately predicts daily sales for various items across different stores involves dealing with complex datasets. Choosing the right model and ensuring its interpretability while managing its complexity could be challenging.
Updating and Adaptation: The requirement to update forecasts as new data comes in demands a dynamic model that can adapt to changing trends, seasonal variations, and other influencing factors. Building a model that can consistently update its predictions in real-time could be a challenge.
Ethical and Privacy Concerns: Handling sensitive data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, and addressing ethical concerns related to using custom
Model Evaluation and Improvement: Continuously evaluating the model's performance and identifying areas for improvement might be challenging, especially without access to all necessary data or if there are constraints on model enhancement.The project also made me realize how using smart data techniques can solve real-world problems.

 
## learned in the project.
Working on this project teaches a bunch of things. Understanding the data is a big part—knowing what it means and how to handle it. Choosing the right models and making them better is also important. Learning to create new things from the data to help make better predictions is cool. We also learn how to check if our predictions are good. Handling real-time data and updating predictions as we get new info is tough but useful to learn.knowing that improvement is an ongoing process and being able to adapt to unexpected situations is a significant lesson from a project like this kind.
Lucky to get chance to do this project.
