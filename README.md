# Maverick-Capstone-s-Project
## Problem Statement 
Maverik, a subsidiary of FJ Management specializing in gas stations and convenience stores, aims to open 30 new stores annually. Accurate performance projections for these new stores are crucial for their successful establishment and continual operations. Our team, known as "Top Gun: Maverik," has been entrusted with developing a forecasting model that surpasses the current simplistic model in use. This new model will leverage available data to project daily revenue at the store level for the upcoming year. It will also forecast the daily sales of specific items such as gasoline, diesel, in-store merchandise, in-store food, and other products.

By delivering precise predictions, our model will enable Maverik to construct more precise financial plans and offer more valuable initial estimations of Return on Investment (ROI). The objective of our Modeling notebook is to address Maverik's revenue forecasting challenge by predicting store sales across various item categories—such as gas and food—on a day-to-day basis for a full year. Additionally, the model will continuously update the annual day-over-day forecast as actual revenue data becomes available. The notebook's purpose is to explore and compare different models to solve this problem, ultimately selecting the best-performing one based on crucial performance metrics, especially focusing on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
